# Speechfeedback

## Problem 
Before I started learning elixir, I was a teacher.  At the end of every semester, I had to grade 200+ kids one minute speech 
and give them a score and personalized feedback.  I enjoyed the speeches and seeing my student's hard work; however,
I was often pressed for time when I was writing the individual feedback for the students. 

## Grammar | Posture | Content
In addition, my teaching-team had already made the grading rubric with three grading categories: Grammar, Posture, Content.
During the students' speeches, I always had enough time to write down the scores, but I often ran out of time making the 
writing the personalized feedback. 

## Solution
My solution to this problem was to create a program that automatically gave feedback to the student by looking at the scores 
and giving feedback based on the scores.
